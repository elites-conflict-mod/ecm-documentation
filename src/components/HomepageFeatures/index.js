				The Alliance to Restore the Republic (2 BBYâ€“4 ABY), commonly known as
				the Rebel Alliance, Alliance, the Rebellion, and rarely the Separatists,
				was a resistance movement formed by Bail Prestor Organa and Mon Mothma
				to oppose the reign of the Galactic Empire. The Alliance was formed from
				a less organized movement to oppose the Empire that existed, which was
				secretly led by Organa. This early group came together from a number of
				rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost and the Phoenix Cell. The
				Atrivis Resistance Group was one of the first cells to join what Mothma
				began calling "the Alliance" before the formal formation of the Alliance
				to Restore the Republic. The Alliance was publicly and formally declared
				with the Declaration of the Rebel Alliance.
